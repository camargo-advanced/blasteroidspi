Implementation of the Asteroids game.  
  
Inspiration came from the book [Head First C: A Brain-Friendly Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-C-Brain-Friendly-Guide/dp/1449399916/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3PXLMYX4NOXK9&keywords=head+first+c&qid=1641307105&sprefix=head+first+c%2Caps%), where the requirements and details of objects were born.  
  
In addition, I also took valuable lessons in game implementation from the book [Beginning Python Games Development With PyGame](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Python-Games-Development-Second/dp/1484209710/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2RZA8MBSIDFR7&keywords=beginning+python+game+development%27&qid=1641307247&sprefix=beginning+python), which I recommend.  

It's also very important to mention the valuable lessons in game programming and the math involved that I gained through the [Code-It-Yourself video! Asteroids (Simple C++ and Maths!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgDR8LrRZhk), plus other videos by the same author that I recommend.  

To run, just clone the repository in terminal, enter the directory and run the following commands:  
`python3 -m venv .venv`   
`python3 -m pip install -U pygame`  
`python3 game.py`  
  
If you are interested in collaborating, please feel free to suggest the inclusion of new features and improvements by github. All suggestions will be analyzed and considered for a future release.
