Implementation of the Asteroids game.
Inspiration came from the book [Head First C: A Brain-Friendly Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-C-Brain-Friendly-Guide/dp/1449399916/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3PXLMYX4NOXK9&keywords=head+first+c&qid=1641307105&sprefix=head+first+c%2Caps%), where the requirements and details of objects were born. In addition, I also took valuable lessons in game implementation from the book [Beginning Python Games Development With PyGame](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Python-Games-Development-Second/dp/1484209710/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2RZA8MBSIDFR7&keywords=beginning+python+game+development%27&qid=1641307247&sprefix=beginning+python), which I recommend.

To run, just clone the repository, enter the directory and run:
`python3 game.py`
